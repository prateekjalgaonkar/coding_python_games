1. War Game:
'War' is a simple card game for two players where the goal is to win all the cards in the deck. Players flip the top card of their stack simultaneously, and the player with the higher card takes both cards and adds them to the bottom of their stack. In case of a tie, a "war" ensues, where players lay down additional cards to determine the winner of the round. 
How to Play:
    1. Deal the cards: Divide the deck evenly between the two players, face down. 
    2. Start the battle: Each player flips the top card of their stack face up. 
    3. Compare cards: The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards, placing them at the bottom of their stack. 
    4. Rank of cards: In War, Aces are high, followed by King, Queen, Jack, and then the number cards in descending order (10 down to 2). 
    5. War: If both players flip the same rank card, it's a "war". Each player places five cards face down, followed by one more card face up. The player with the higher face-up card in the "war" wins all the cards played in that round. 
    6. Continue playing: The game continues until one player has all the cards.
